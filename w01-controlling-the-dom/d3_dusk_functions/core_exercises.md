## Challenges

1. Write a 'sayHello' function that logs 'Hello' to the console.
  
2. Rewrite 'sayHello' to accept a name as a parameter, and logs 'Hello' + the name to the console.

3. Write a `multiply` function that finds the product of two numbers.

  ```js
  multiply(5, 7) => 35
  ```
3. Write a 'negative' function that takes an integer, and if that integer is positive, it turns it into a negative integer and returns that integer. 

2. Write a function that takes in a number and returns `true` if the number is even and `false` if the number is odd (**Hint:** Look up the `%` operator).

  ```js
  isEven(4) => true
  ```


4. Write a function that generates a random number in a specified range (**Hint:** Look up Math.random()).

  ```js
  getRand(5, 10) => 8 (any number between 5 and 10)
  ```


5. Write a function that generates an array of specified length that contains random numbers from 1 to 100.

  ```js
  randArr(3) => [23, 11, 82]
  ```

3. Write a function that swaps two values at two different indexes in an array.

  ```js
  swap(["moe", "larry", "curly"], 0, 2) => ["curly", "larry", "moe"]
  ```
