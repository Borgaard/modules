# Wednesday Homework!

### Work through tutorial Option 1 or 2 and continue:

1. Tutorial Option 1: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery" target="_blank">jQuery on Code Academy</a>.

1. Tutorial Option 2: <a href="http://try.jquery.com/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank">jQuery on Code School</a>.

1. Check out the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery Documentation</a>. Read the `.append()`, `.css()` and `.html()` core methods and under Effects, please read `.hide()`, `.show()` and `.animate()`. (Can you read more than this? Of course! But these are very useful and relatively easy to implement.)

1. Inside your  `22-homework/GITHUB_NAME` or `23-homework/GITHUB_NAME` repo, create a file called `day3.html`.

1. Import jQuery in `day3.html`, create some content with text and at least one image. Add three buttons and implement three different jQuery methods. (Can you implement methods not listed above? Of course! But please make sure the user can SEE something unique change on your page for each button press.)

1. Use the homework submission instructions from the `22-homework` or `23-homework` repo to submit your homework through a pull request!
